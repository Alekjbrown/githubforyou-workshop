# Exercise 1, Hello World

> Hello world is often the first program you build when learning to program. You simply program the computer to output a line of text called "Hell World"

This first exercise is the simplest in the git workflow: clone, change, commit, push changes. You have a repository on GitHub that you'd like to work on locally. Make a few updates and then push those changes back to GitHub.

Objectives:
1. Create a repository on GitHub
2. Clone directory to your local environment
3. Make some changes and then publish those changes back to GitHub
